These data are included in the `listings.csv` \nfile which should be available along with this notebook.\n\nThe data set includes the following variables:\n\n* `id` - ID number of the listing\n* `price` - Price, in GBP, for one night stay\n* `neighbourhood` - Neighbourhood listing is located in\n* `accommodates` - Number of people listing accommodates\n* `bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms\n* `bedrooms` - Number of bedrooms\n* `beds` - Number of beds (which can be different than the number of bedrooms)\n* `review_scores_rating` - Average rating of property\n* `number_of_reviews` - Number of reviews\n* `listing_url` - Listing URL\n\n\nWe will read in these data using pandas with the following code,","metadata":{"cell_id":"00004-2470baa9-c8c5-4f59-b473-835101426505","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00005-c59e112e-5a2f-461f-af2e-df4fff652efd","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"5e50d5fd","execution_millis":170,"output_cleared":true,"execution_start":1610537806772,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import pandas as pd\n\nd = pd.read_csv(\"listings.csv\")\nd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note here we print out the pandas dataframe object by returning it at the end of the cell, generally when we want to output something in a notebook it is better to use an explicit `print` function call but in this case we want to take advantage of Jupyter's ability to nicely display the pandas data frame output.\n\nBelow are a couple of quick exercises to re-familiarize yourself with pandas.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00006-4c787aa6-ff13-4377-b3a0-70b82b39123b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### &diams; Exercise 1\n\nHow many observations are included in this data set?","metadata":{"cell_id":"00007-9a4bdd80-6e68-4d3c-8c20-3e8df63efc9f","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00008-e7141545-9fc9-4cfe-9698-d2c146d5c38a","output_cleared":true,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"6af978a7","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Enter your code here","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### &diams; Exercise 2\n\nHow many different neighborhoods are represented in these data?","metadata":{"cell_id":"00009-d03f00d1-9c3f-4bca-a80a-79849df7c9e4","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00012-5ac1f108-89e2-4e71-b797-41a061812e1a","output_cleared":true,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"6af978a7","execution_millis":2,"execution_start":1610537813087,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Enter your code here","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### &diams; Exercise 3\n\nWhat is the mean and the median price per night of an Airbnb in Edinburgh?","metadata":{"cell_id":"00013-373116d6-756a-4b2a-a002-0d23fa184317","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00014-a2c006dd-d9bc-4238-95eb-082eb64955ed","output_cleared":true,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"6af978a7","execution_millis":74,"execution_start":1610537807007,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Enter your code here","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### &diams; Exercise 4\n\nCalculate a new column called `beds_per_bedroom` which is the number of beds divided by the number bedrooms for a listing.
